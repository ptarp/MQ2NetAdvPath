## play

```txt
========= Advance Pathing Help =========
/play [pathName|off] [stop] [pause|unpause] [loop|noloop] [smart|nosmart] [flee|noflee] [door|nodoor] [fast|slow] [eval|noeval]

[listcustom] [show] [help] [setflag1]-[setflag9] [y/n] [resetflags]
The /play command will execute each command on the line. The commands that should be used single, or at the end of a line:
[off] plist] [listcustom] [show] [help]

setflag1-setflag9 can be used anywhere in the line and uses the following format:
/play setflag1 n pathname or /play pathname setflag n (n can be any single alpha character)
AdvPath flags can be accessed using ${AdvPath.Flag1} - ${AdvPath.Flag9}
/play resetflags resets all flags(1-9) to 'y'

*Eval -- If the current location has a checkpoint that starts with slash (/) Evalute it like mq2melee does.
Loop -- continues play back
Pause -- stops the play back at the current point.
unPause -- if paused continue from where left off.
Normal -- play path forward.
Reverse -- play path backward
